# Slice: 4D Shooter

**Slice** is a competitive multiplayer first-person shooter that takes place in a **true four-dimensional space**. It is developed as free and open-source software under the **AGPLv3** license.
Our **goal** is to create the first **free and open-source esports shooter in 4D space**.  [**Help us create it!**](https://slice4d.info/#donate)

## Technology Overview

**Slice: 4D Shooter** is built on a **custom game engine**, developed from scratch in **Rust**.
The project is currently in playable prototype stage. 

**Core engine features include:**
*   **4D Rendering:** Utilizes a Signed Distance Field (SDF) algorithm to render four-dimensional geometry.
*   **4D Physics:** Features a custom-built physics engine, also SDF-based, to handle movement and collisions in 4D space.
*   **Actor-based Architecture:** Uses an actor-in-arena-based game logic architecture.
*   **Destructible Environment:** Supports environment destruction using the SDF-based physics and rendering systems.
*   **Multiplayer Networking:** Implements a temporary client-based networking model for multiplayer gameplay and game state synchronization.
*   **Cross-Platform Support:** The game runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Technical Requirements

The chosen method for visualizing 4D geometry (an SDF-based rendering algorithm) is demanding on the GPU. A **minimum recommended video card** for a smooth experience is an **Nvidia RTX 3060** or its equivalent.

For weaker hardware, the Slice prototype includes tools to control performance:

*   **Lower Resolution:** Press `Num 7` to decrease the rendering resolution. Each press reduces it by 5%, which can significantly increase framerate.
*   **Higher Resolution:** Press `Num 8` to increase the rendering resolution by 5%.
*   **Shadows:** Press `Num 9` to toggle shadow rendering on/off. Disabling shadows can greatly improve performance.

Slice: 4D Shooter is in a playable prototype stage, and we have observed launch issues on some older laptops with integrated graphics and other specific hardware, particularly on Windows.

If you encounter technical problems (crashes, bugs, performance issues), please report them:
*   By creating an `issue` in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/maffi44/slice-4d-shooter/issues).
*   Or by sending a detailed report to: **slice4d-bugs-report@pm.me**.

**Please include in your report:**
1.  A description of the error or problem.
2.  Your hardware specifications (GPU model, CPU, RAM).
3.  Your operating system version.

## Build the Game Client

[**Here you can download the game client version for Windows that is ready to install and auto-updates.**](https://maffi44.itch.io/slice4d)

### To Build the project, you need to install the **Rust Programming Language** and the **Cargo** utility. 

For unix-like operating systems:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
For Windows, you need to download `rustup-init.exe` according to [**this link**](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/other.html).

### Build on Debian-based Linux distros

Install dependencies:

```bash
apt install build-essential pkg-config libasound2-dev
```

Build the game client:

```bash
cargo build --release --bin game-client
```

### Build on RHEL-based Linux distros

Install dependencies:

```powershell
cargo build --release --bin game-client-without-autoupdate --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

---

## Launching the game

After compiling and launching the game client (created in the `target` directory), shader compilation is underway, which may take some time, depending on the performance of your computer.

If the FPS of the game client is **too low**, you can press the `NumPad 7` key (each tap reduces the screen resolution by 5 percent) to degrade the graphics rendering parameters.

If you want to play online on your own servers, you need to create a game-client `settings.json` executable file in the same directory, and enter the ipv4 address and port of the matchmaking server in the `matchmaking_server_url` field.

```bash
tee settings.json > /dev/null <<EOF
{
    "mouse_sensivity" : 0.21,

    "matchmaking_server_url" : "ws://8.8.8.8:45123/",

    "bash_and_turn_servers" : [],

    "turn_server_username" : "homeo",
    "turn_server_credential" : "homeo",
    
    "screen_resolution_scale" : 1.0
}
EOF
```

**The `settings.json` file is not required for single-player mode or for playing on the official Slice: 4D Shooter servers.**

Currently, the client can make several connection attempts until success is achieved.

The address `8.8.8.8` must be replaced with the hosting address of your server.

## Hosting your own servers

#### While on the game node, follow these steps:

#### 1) Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maffi44/slice-4d-shooter.git
```

#### 2) Install dependencies:

For RHEL-based Linux distros

```bash
dnf install gcc make glibc-devel pkgconf-pkg-config alsa-lib-devel
```

For Debian-based Linux distros

```bash
apt install build-essential pkg-config libasound2-dev
```

#### 3) Compile matchmaking server

```bash
cd slice-4d-shooter
```
```bash
cargo build --release -p matchmaking_server
```

#### 4) Compile game server

```bash
cargo build --release -p game_server
```

Matchmaking server and game server **must** be located in the same directory.

#### 5) Create the matchmaking-server-config.json configuration file for the matchmaking server

Go to the directory where matchmaking_server is located.

```bash
cd target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release
```

Ð¡reate a matchmaking-server-config.json file.

```bash
tee matchmaking-server-config.json > /dev/null <<EOF
{
  "current_game_version": "0.5.2",
  "matchmaking_server_ip": "8.8.8.8",
  "matchmaking_server_port_for_clients": 45123,
  "matchmaking_server_port_for_servers": 45124,
  "clients_connecting_via_proxy_server": false,
  "proxy_server_ip": "8.8.8.8",
  "proxy_server_port": 45122,
  "game_severs_public_ip": "8.8.8.8",
  "game_severs_min_port_for_signaling_servers": 45125,
  "game_severs_max_port_for_signaling_servers": 46125,
  "game_severs_min_port_for_tcp_listener": 45125,
  "game_severs_max_port_for_tcp_listener": 46125,
  "game_severs_ice_config": {
    "urls": [
      "stun:stun.l.google.com:19302",
      "stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302"
    ],
    "username": "homeo",
    "credential": "homeo"
  },
  "max_game_sessions": 10,
  "max_players_per_game_session": 6
}
EOF
```

The address `8.8.8.8` **needs to be replaced** with your hosting address.

### Using a Proxy Server (e.g., NGINX)

If you **do not want to use a proxy server**, such as NGINX, which sits between the players and the game servers, then set the field `clients_connecting_via_proxy_server` to `false`.

If you **do want to use a proxy**, set `clients_connecting_via_proxy_server` to `true` and make sure to fill in the `proxy_server_ip` and `proxy_server_port` fields accordingly.

Below is an example NGINX configuration that acts as a WebSocket proxy between players and game servers. This example uses Lua to restrict access only to a specific port range.

The allowed port range in the Lua block **must match** the ranges defined in your `matchmaking-server-config.json` file:

```json
"game_severs_min_port_for_signaling_servers": 45125,
"game_severs_max_port_for_signaling_servers": 46125,
"game_severs_min_port_for_tcp_listener": 45125,
"game_severs_max_port_for_tcp_listener": 46125
```

#### Example NGINX Config (with Lua port filtering)

```nginx
# path: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/your-config.conf

server {
    listen 45122;

    location ~ ^/ws/(\d+)$ {
        set $target_port $1;

        access_by_lua_block {
            local port = tonumber(ngx.var.target_port)
            if not port or port < 45125 or port > 46125 then
                ngx.status = 403
                ngx.say("Port out of allowed range")
                return ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_FORBIDDEN)
            end
        }

        rewrite ^/ws/\d+$ / break;

        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:$target_port;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_read_timeout 3600;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

In this example, only ports `45125` to `46125` are allowed.  
Make sure to update this range to match your actual configured ranges in `matchmaking-server-config.json`.

In order for the nginx config from this example to work, you need to install the nginx extras package.
```bash
apt install nginx-extras
```

#### Additional Configuration Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `clients_connecting_via_proxy_server` | Whether a **proxy server** (e.g., NGINX) will be used between clients and game servers. Set to `true` to enable proxying, `false` to allow direct connections. |
| `proxy_server_ip` | IP address of the proxy server that clients will connect to (if proxying is enabled). |
| `proxy_server_port` | Port on which the proxy server listens for client connections. Must match the `listen` directive in the NGINX config (e.g., `45122`). |
