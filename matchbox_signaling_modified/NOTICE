Modification: Client Connection Timeout

    Description:
    Disconnects a client if no packet is received from them for 3 seconds.

    Reason for Change:
    A bug was discovered during testing where a client process crashing or losing connection abruptly (without sending a proper WebSocket close signal) would leave the signaling server in a "connected" state indefinitelyâ€”until the server itself shuts down.

    Impact:
    Modifications were required in crate matchbox_signaling to enforce cleanup of stale connections and prevent "ghost clients."

    Note:
    This is particularly important for unstable networks or clients that may terminate unexpectedly (e.g., mobile apps, crashed processes).
